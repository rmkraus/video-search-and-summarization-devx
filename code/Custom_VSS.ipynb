    "The summarize API also accepts parameters to control the LLM during summary generation. The important ones to note are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `max_tokens` controls the maximum length of summary generation. This is a hard cutoff and does not change model output. Typically, `1024` is accetable, but smaller values could result in lower costs.\n",
    "- `temperature` and `top_p` parameters influence the probabilities when choosing the next output token. Generally, lower values tend towards more consistent, but less insightful, responses.\n",
    "- `seed` helps control the repeatability of outputs by steering random number generation. Pinning this to a specific value helps us test the changes of other parameters."
