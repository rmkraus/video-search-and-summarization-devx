# Video Search and Summarization (VSS)

A powerful AI-powered solution for video analytics that enables industrial operators to interact with their infrastructure through intelligent search and summarization of video data.

## Overview

This project implements NVIDIA's AI Blueprint for video search and summarization (VSS), which combines vision language models (VLMs), large language models (LLMs), and NVIDIA NIMâ„¢ to deliver advanced video analytics capabilities. The system allows you to:

- Process and analyze live or archived video sensor data
- Search through video content using natural language queries
- Generate intelligent summaries of video content
- Monitor and alert on specific events or conditions
- Integrate with enterprise systems through a REST API
